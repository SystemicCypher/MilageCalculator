# MileageCalculator
## A small python script that uses google maps to find round trip distances for tax purposes

### Goals

Calculate round trips for independent contractor mileage tax deduction. I was too lazy to do this by hand, so I just made Python 3.7 do it for me.

BTW, this depends on Python 3.7 and Selenium (which kinda goes unused). Granted, I don't really use any 3.7 specific features... but that's there for info.
